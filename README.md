The Programming Language Amber 
==============================

Amber is a open source scripting language, which is being developed for easy realization of **High-Level Programming with Self-Extension**.
The term "self-extension" means a way to extend languages' syntaxes or semantics using capabilities of themselves, and it includes following techniques:

* Macros
* Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)
* Extensible Syntax
* Meta-Programming
* Dynamic and Static Reflection

Writing programs with high-level abstraction is very important in terms of productivity, portability and performance. Since the optimal programming language is different according to programming targets in general, capabilities of self-extension are also important.
Amber has been designed and developed placing the highest priority to self-extension from the start, so self-extension of Amber is easy and has high-degree of freedom.
